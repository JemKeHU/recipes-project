  <p>There's a lot of love in those dumplings! This is comfort food at its best and so worth the time and effort. I love the ohhs, awws, and OMGs, smiles, and sighs of total satisfaction that come with this bowl of heaven.</p>

    <li>1 small onion, chopped</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon mashed garlic</li>
    <li>2 large bay leaves</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon dried thyme</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
    <li>⅛ teaspoon poultry seasoning</li>
    <li>2 pounds bone-in chicken breasts</li>
    <li>water to cover</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons self-rising flour (such as White Lily®)</li>
    <li>2 cups self-rising flour (such as White Lily®)</li>
    <li>¼ cup cold shortening</li>
    <li>¼ cup chicken broth, slightly chilled</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
    <li>Melt butter in a stock pot over medium-high heat. Add celery, carrot, onion, garlic, bay leaves, thyme, salt, pepper, and poultry seasoning; cook and stir until flavors combine, about 5 minutes.</li>
    <li>Push vegetable mixture to the sides and add chicken; cook until browned, 3 to 5 minutes per side.</li>
    <li>Pour enough water over the chicken to cover by 3 inches; bring to a boil. Stir, scraping the browned bits off of the bottom of the pot. Reduce heat; simmer until chicken is tender, about 1 hour.</li>
    <li>Transfer chicken and carrots to a serving plate with a large slotted spoon; let cool.</li>
    <li>Ladle 1/4 cup cooking liquid into a bowl; cool slightly, about 5 minutes. Mix in 2 tablespoons flour. Stir back into the pot.</li>
    <li>Place 2 cups flour in a large bowl; cut in shortening with 2 knives until mixture forms pea-sized bits. Mix in chilled chicken broth until dough is combined.</li>
    <li>Turn dough out onto a floured work surface. Knead 5 to 6 times; pat down to 1-inch thickness. Sprinkle lightly with flour; roll out to about 1/8-inch thickness. Cut dough into squares with a sharp knife.</li>
    <li>Drop squares, in batches, into simmering cooking liquid, moving squares to the side with each addition. Partially cover pot; simmer until dumplings are firm, about 12 minutes. Separate any dumplings that stick together. Remove from heat; keep covered.</li>
    <li>Bone chicken; cut into bite-sized pieces and return to the pot. Chop carrot; return to the pot. Cool chicken and dumplings, about 30 minutes, before serving.</li>
    <li>Enjoy!</li>

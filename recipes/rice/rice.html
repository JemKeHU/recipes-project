  <h1>Blackened Catfish and Spicy Rice</h1>
  <img src="rice.png" alt="A picture of 'Blackened Catfish and Spicy Rice'">
  <p>A quick and easy blackened catfish and rice recipe. I like to serve this over a Cajun flavored spicy white rice. Although the rice is optional, the slightly spicy Cajun flavor of the rice brings out the taste of the catfish.</p>
  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>1 cup white rice</li>
    <li>2 cups water</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon Cajun seasoning</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon hot pepper sauce</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon ground thyme</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon ground cayenne pepper</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon garlic powder</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon onion powder</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon paprika</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon dried dill weed</li>
    <li>¼ teaspoon lemon pepper</li>
    <li>2 (8 ounce) fillets catfish</li>
    <li>½ cup butter, melted</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon lemon juice, or to taste</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Bring rice, water, Cajun seasoning, and hot pepper sauce to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until rice is tender, and liquid has been absorbed, 20 to 25 minutes.</li>
    <li>While rice is cooking, mix thyme, black pepper, cayenne pepper, salt, garlic powder, onion powder, paprika, dill weed, and lemon pepper in a bowl until well blended. Brush catfish fillets with butter and sprinkle with seasoning mixture other both sides.</li>
    <li>Heat any remaining melted butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat; pan-fry seasoned catfish in butter until fish is easily flaked with a fork, 4 to 5 minutes per side.</li>
    <li>Serve catfish over a plate of seasoned rice. Pour leftover butter from the skillet over fish and sprinkle with lemon juice.</li>
  </ol>
